# Rockbuster Analysis
Identifying a mock company's (Rockbuster) sale trends as a video rental business to lay the groundwork as they move towards online streaming.  
# Rockbuster   Stealth   Data   Analysis   Project  
Introduction - I have been hired as a data analyst to utilize SQL to find patterns and trends to lay a foundation  for Rockbuster's move to  online streaming. Using the  2020 data they provided, I will look across countries, genres, and sales to best allocate funds to Rockbuster's top consumers and  increase retention rate to compete with prominent streaming companies. 
## Key Questions
- Which   movies   contributed   the   most/least   to   revenue   gain?     
- What   was   the   average   rental   duration   for   all   videos?  
- Which   countries   are   Rockbuster   customers   based   in?   
- Where   are   customers   with   a   high   lifetime   value   based?  
- Do   sales   figures   vary   between   geographic   regions?  
## Context
This project demonstrates the capabilities of SQL due to the in-depth analysis it is capable of. It is shown that it uses various queries to compare and contrast different sale categories, customers, and geographical locations to provide Ropckbuster with the most information and ensure its best chance at a successful launch in the online streaming market.  
## Data Set 
The data set contains Rockbvuster's current film licenses, sales, customers, store locations, and employees, which were loaded into the SQL database. The data set is a zip file. If you want to review the raw data, contact me through Github, and I will share it. 
## Data Dictionary
The company needed a thorough data dictionary. This is the PDF version, and I still have the original document to make further changes if the company fails to update the data dictionary. <a href="https://github.com/MaverickFigueira/RockbusterAnalysis/blob/main/Rockbuster%20Data%20Dictionary.pdf"> Link to Rockbuster Data Dictionary </a>
## Presentation of the Analysis
Through PowerPoint, I created a thorough and digestible presentation for the stakeholders. It provides the questions they asked and how looking through data answers their questions, and it gives the stakeholders direction with statistics to back the approach. <a href="https://github.com/MaverickFigueira/RockbusterAnalysis/blob/main/Rockbuster%203.10.pptx"> Link to Powerpoint Presentation </a>
